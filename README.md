#Recipe Book

Imagine a world where you could store all your favorite recipes online in one simple place.
That is exactly the world that we are building with this application to store and change recipes.

## Installation


Retrieve the included Gemfile and Run the following command
```
bundle install
```

## Usage

To use the app run
```
ruby app.rb
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:4567. 
 
 From here you are able to add recipes, categories, and ingredients that you would like to use for your recipe.
 You can also remove a recipe, its ingredients, or any categories but also change the names of each as well.
